I'm a Physics student at the University of Antioquia, currently in my eighth semester. I'm passionate about programming, data science, and solving complex problems through mathematical, statistical, and computational tools.

Throughout my academic journey, I've worked on projects involving physical simulations, modeling of complex systems, and data analysis using Python, SQL, and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I've also explored foundational machine learning techniques and numerical methods applied to scientific problems.

I'm especially interested in the intersection between science and technology—how to extract value from data, understand hidden patterns in physical or social systems, and build solutions grounded in logic and analysis. I believe in continuous learning, in the power of clean and efficient code, and in the beauty of finding structure within chaos.

I'm currently focused on strengthening my skills in data science, artificial intelligence, and data visualization. I'm open to collaboration on projects where I can contribute my knowledge and grow as a computational scientist.
